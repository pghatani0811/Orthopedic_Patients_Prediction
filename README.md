# Orthopedic_Patients_Prediction

### Section I : Accessing the Data

Make a pandas DataFrame from the CSV
- How many variables does the dataset contain?
- What is the data about?
- What are we trying to predict here?
### Section II : Exploratory Data Analysis
- Perform some descriptive statistics and make a note of your findings
- Plot appropriate graphs to understand the relation between the variables.
- Point out any observations and comment on the strength of the relationships if any.
### Section III : Prepare data for Training!
- Make a new column symptom_class with the abnormal rows as 1 and the normal rows as 0, drop the class column
- Split the entire dataset into independent features and symptoms as the response variable
- Normalize the variables.
### Section IV : Training with KNN
- Use train_test_split from sklearn and split the parameters and classes into train and test sets
- Starting with three nearest neighbours , train your KNN model and make a note of accuracy and other diagnostics for both training and test sets.
- Try with increasing the k value and check if there is any improvement in model performance. Use different value to arrive at the optimal value of k.
- Evaluate your final model using appropriate metrics for classification and comment on them.
### Section V : Training with Naive Bayes
- Now , fit a Naive Bayes Classifier to the same data.
- Train a NB model with default arguments and make a note of training and test metrics
- What are your inferences on the relative performance between the KNN and NB based models?
- Which of these models would you recommend and with what reasons ?
### Section VI : Wraping it up ! (This is optional but good for... like spinach...)
- Which of these models performed better ?
- Test these two models on other datasets as well !
- To get started you could try these on
